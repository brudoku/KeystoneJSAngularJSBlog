# keystoneAngularBlog
Single page app blog using AngularJS for the front end and Node KeystoneJS for the back end. Blog posts can contain custom Javascript run on-the-fly with ocLazyLoad. 

To use, copy contents into a new KeystoneJS installation folder and overwrite all files. This is currently designed to support one category per post, not multiple categories.
